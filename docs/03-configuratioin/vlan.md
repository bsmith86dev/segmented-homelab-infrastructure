# Phase 5 Completion Report

**Date**: 10/20/25
**Duration**: 2hrs
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Firewall Rules Summary

### Security Model
**Default Policy**: Deny All (pfSense default)
**Approach**: Explicit allow rules per VLAN

### Rule Configuration by VLAN

#### Trusted VLANs (Full Network Access)
| VLAN | Interface | Rule | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| LAN | 10.0.10.1 | Pass any → any | Administrative access (default) |
| MGT | 10.0.20.1 | Pass any → any | Infrastructure management |
| PURP | 10.0.62.1 | Pass any → any | Network monitoring (needs visibility) |

#### Semi-Trusted VLANs (Internet + Selective LAN)
| VLAN | Interface | Rule | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| SRVC | 10.0.30.1 | Pass any → any | Services (will refine later) |
| MEDIA | 10.0.40.1 | Pass any → any | Media servers |
| GAMING | 10.0.60.1 | Pass any → any | Client devices |

**Note**: These currently allow full network access. Will add granular inter-VLAN rules in future optimization phase.

#### Untrusted VLANs (Internet ONLY - Isolated)
| VLAN | Interface | Rules | Isolation Level |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| IOT | 10.0.50.1 | Block 10.0.0.0/8 → Pass any | **MAXIMUM** - Zero trust |
| RED | 10.0.61.1 | Block 10.0.0.0/8 → Pass any | **HIGH** - Security testing |
| GUEST | 10.0.70.1 | Block 10.0.0.0/8 → Pass any | **HIGH** - Visitor isolation |

### Security Features Implemented

**IoT Isolation** ✅
- IoT devices CANNOT access any internal network (10.0.0.0/8)
- IoT devices CAN ONLY access Internet
- All blocked attempts are logged for monitoring

**Red Team Isolation** ✅
- Red Team isolated from internal networks by default
- Can add temporary allow rules for specific testing targets
- All access attempts logged

**Guest Network Isolation** ✅
- Guest devices completely isolated from homelab
- Internet-only access
- Logged for security monitoring

**Monitoring Exception** ✅
- Purple Team (monitoring) has full network visibility
- Required for IDS/IPS and traffic analysis

## Rule Order (Critical for Isolated VLANs)

**For IOT, RED, GUEST:**
```
1. Block: [VLAN] net → 10.0.0.0/8 (evaluated FIRST)
2. Pass: [VLAN] net → any (evaluated SECOND)
```

**Why order matters:**
- pfSense evaluates rules top-to-bottom
- First match wins
- Block rules MUST come before allow rules
- If reversed, allow-any would match first, negating the block

## Testing Status

### Current Testing (Phase 5)
- ✅ Rules created and applied
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ⏳ Full testing pending (needs switch + devices on VLANs)

### Future Testing (Phase 7-8)
- Test IoT isolation (ping from IoT to 10.0.20.1 should FAIL)
- Test internet from IoT (ping 8.8.8.8 should SUCCEED)
- Test inter-VLAN communication
- Review firewall logs for blocked traffic

## Logging Configuration

**Enabled logging on:**
- IOT block rule (monitor attempted LAN access)
- RED block rule (monitor security testing attempts)
- GUEST block rule (monitor guest isolation)

**View logs:** Firewall → Log Files → Firewall

## Future Optimization (Post-Phase 8)

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Granular Inter-VLAN Rules**:
   - Allow GAMING → MEDIA (ports 32400, 8096 for streaming)
   - Allow SRVC → MGT (port 22, 8006 for management)
   - Block everything else by default

2. **Service-Specific Rules**:
   - Allow only necessary ports between VLANs
   - Block all other traffic

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limit IoT bandwidth
   - Limit Guest bandwidth
   - Prioritize GAMING traffic (QoS)

4. **Alias Groups**:
   - Create firewall aliases for common services
   - Simplify rule management

5. **Scheduled Rules**:
   - Time-based access (e.g., Guest network hours)

## Network Security Summary

**Before Phase 5:**
- ❌ All VLANs blocked (no rules = no traffic)
- ❌ No inter-VLAN communication
- ❌ No internet access from VLANs

**After Phase 5:**
- ✅ All VLANs have internet access
- ✅ Trusted VLANs have full network access
- ✅ Untrusted VLANs (IoT/Guest/Red) ISOLATED from LAN
- ✅ Monitoring VLAN has full visibility
- ✅ Logging enabled for security monitoring

## Security Posture

**Threat Model Addressed:**
- ✅ Compromised IoT device cannot pivot to internal network
- ✅ Guest devices cannot access homelab resources
- ✅ Red Team testing contained to authorized targets
- ✅ Management VLAN has full control capability
- ✅ Monitoring can observe all network traffic

[List any problems and solutions]

## Next Steps
- Phase 6: NAT Configuration (verify/optimize)
- Phase 7: Managed Switch Setup (trunk VLANs to switch)
- Phase 8: Proxmox Migration (to Management VLAN)
- Phase 9: Test all firewall rules with real devices
